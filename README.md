## Project React Testing Library

Project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The project was made to test my testing skills with the __React Testing Library__ (RTL).

### Skills Developed

With this project I was able to:

 - Use queries from __RTL__ on automated tests.
 - Simulate events with __RTL__ on automated tests.
 - Test asynchronous logical fluxes with __RTL__.
 - Write tests that allow refactoring of the application components structure without the need of them to change.
 - Create mocks from APIs utilizing fetch.
 - Test inputs.
